        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Hypothesis</h3>

        <p>We believe that having separate queues for benefits means that:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>people can see when they have tasks to do that they need someone else to do (because they don't have access)</li>
          <li>if a benefit system isn't working due to technical issues people can carry on working on tasks for other benefits</li>
          <li>people can do all tasks for one benefit as a group, they don't have to switch systems</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

        <p>We believe that providing a search by NINO function allows agents to view historic records for management checks or find the information needed to answer enquiries</p>

        <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

        <p>We believe that providing an edit option for the response on a historic record allows agents to update a task from not updated to updated or handed off when they have more information </p>

        <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

        <p>We believe that having a overall count of the team tasks to be completed allows everyone to see when there is a period of high fluctuation and more people might be needed to help out</p>

        <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

        <p>We believe that highlighting if there are tasks that approach 3 days - it will help people prioritise those benefits first</p>

        <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

        <p>We believe that if I want to 'pause' a task (for example pass to team leader to do a bank validation check) the task will be 'closed' and the NINO passed to the team leader - the team leader can then pick up the task through a NINO search and update the response on the customer history page</p>

        <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

        <p>We believe that they might come up with their own ways to split tasks fairly between themselves and keep track of how many each person has done (e.g. tally on paper)</p>
